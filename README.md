# PayProcess
 Single and multi chain defpacts for paying for complex mint operations. We are going to test single and multi chain
 payments for the NFT minter.

 Step 1: Evaluate if defun pay has been successfully run
 Step 2: Evaluate if minting was successful
 Step 3: Release or return the payment based on stop 1 and 2 true/false values

Using components from Pascals bootstrap repl repo to populate the environment.
